The fifth location (Mustang's office) was added as a last ditch effort to complete this assignment in time because I couldn't figure out how to get my original idea to work. 

Originally, if you spoke to Havoc+Breda AFTER investigating the "RESTRICTED" door in the library, you would get an option to say something like "I already checked the library and didn't see Major Elric" when Havoc tells you that Elric is in the library. 

Then, Havoc+Breda would tell you to ask Sheska (unused character) for help because she spends all her time in the library.

If you speak to Fuery after that, you would get an option to ask where Sheska is. Fuery would lead you to Sheska, Sheska would lead you into the restricted section, and then you would find Elric.
